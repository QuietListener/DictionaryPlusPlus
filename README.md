# Dictionary++

Inspired by [Dictionary+](http://iphone.qualityindex.com/apps/571492/dictionary) (pulled from the store for violating the [`UIReferenceLibraryViewController` terms of use](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uireferencelibraryviewcontroller)), Dictionary++ is a simple interface to iOS's system dictionary.

Since this app also violates the aforementioned rules, it can't be submitted to the App Store and thus you need to compile, sign and install it on your devices yourself if you want to use it.
